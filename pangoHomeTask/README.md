### Running from terminal

In order for you to run the test from the CLI, you will need to run this command:

```
python main.py --threshold THRESHOLD --api_key YOUR_API_KEY_HERE 
```
--api_key is required

--threshold is not required, in case it won't be specified the threshold will be 3 by default.
